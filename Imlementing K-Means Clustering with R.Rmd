```{r}

#let view the data then we can analyse.
crimeNaless <- na.omit(USArrests)
crime <- data.matrix(crimeNaless)
str(crime)
crime

# will choose 5 as the number of cluster. The syntax is : kmeans( data, k) 
# where k is the number of cluster centers.
cluster <- kmeans(crime,5)
class(cluster)

#let's analyse the clustering
str(cluster)

#the str() function gives the structure of the kmeans with the following parameters:
#withinss, betweenss, etc, analyzing which you can find out the performance of kmeans.

#betweenss : Between sum of squares for instance Intracluster similarity

#withinss : Within sum of square such as Intercluster similarity

#totwithinss : Sum of all the withinss of all the clusters : Total intra-cluster similarity

#Let see how we can find the optimal value of 'k'.

# Dissortion : can be calculated in terms of withinss.
# Lesser the value of 'withinss' of a particular cluster,
# more densely populated it will be, thus minimum distortion
#This function takes up the data and the value of k 
#and returns the 'km$totwithinss' for it
kmeans.wss.k <- function(crime, k){
  km = kmeans(crime, k)
  return (km$tot.withinss)
}

kmeans.wss.k(crime,5) # what is the value of withinss for k=5

# lets increase k value. let go with 10
kmeans.wss.k(crime,10)

#It can be seen that as the value of K increases, distortion decreases.

#We can take out the different values of 'km$totwithinss' 
#and plot them in a graph to find the relationship 
#between distortion and the value of k. 
#The following function does that for us:
kmeans.dis <- function(crime, maxk){
  dis=(nrow(crime)-1)*sum(apply(crime,2,var))
  dis[2:maxk]=sapply (2:maxk, kmeans.wss.k, crime=crime)
  return(dis)
}
maxk = 10
dis = kmeans.dis(crime, maxk);
plot(1:maxk, dis, type='b', xlab="Number of Clusters",
     ylab="Distortion",
     col="red")

#Elbow Curve: This is the plot between 'k', the number of clusters 
#and the 'totwithinss' (or distortion) for each value of k. 
#With less cluster, there is a significant decrease in distortion too. 
#This value of k(4) beyond which the distortion rate becomes constant is the optimal value

#Let us apply some animation to understand how R gave us the clustered results.

library(animation)
cluster<- kmeans.ani(crime, 4)

#The clustering accuracy can be determined by the animation chart of K-means clustering using 
#the 'animation" package which shows the clustering process. 
#If the clusters groups or centres aren't overlapping with each other we can conclude
#the clustering accuracy. We also can measure the accuracy of the new labelling by comparing it 
#with the original labeling (original labelling is the ground truth) i.e using a table function

#It can be seen that the data is divided into 4 clusters. 
# And the cluster centers are :

cluster$centers

#Cluster-4 with 'Oregon' as the cluster center has a huge crime rate.

#Cluster-3 and Cluster-2 follow up.
